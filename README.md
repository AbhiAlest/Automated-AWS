<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

* Go (version 1.16 or later)
* Docker (optional, if you want to run the application in a container)
* AWS CLI (to interact with AWS services)

<h3>Clone the Repository</h3>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhiAlest/Automated-AWS.git
```

<h3>Install Dependencies</h3>

Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd Automated-AWS
```

Install the Go dependencies:

```go
go mod download
```

<h3>Configure AWS Credentials (if applicable)</h3>

```
aws configure
```

<h3>Build and Run</h3>
To build and run the project, use the following command:

```go
go run main.go
```
If you want to run the application in a Docker container, build the Docker image first:

```bash
docker build -t myapp .
```

Then, run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp
```

<h3>Running Tests</h3>
To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```

<h3>Development Workflow</h3>

1. Make the necessary code changes in the project files.
2. Run the application or tests to verify your changes.
3. Commit the changes to your local Git repository.
4. Push the changes to the remote Git repository (if applicable).

<h3>Additional Configuration</h3>
